Introduction
The E-Learning Frontend Application is a dynamic and user-friendly web-based platform designed to provide learners with an interactive educational experience. Built using Bootstrap, HTML, and JavaScript, this application ensures a responsive and engaging interface that adapts seamlessly across different devices. The platform is ideal for students, professionals, and educators who want to access educational content, track their learning progress, and engage with interactive features to enhance their knowledge.

Features
1. User-Friendly Interface
The application offers a clean and intuitive UI powered by Bootstrap, ensuring a smooth navigation experience. Users can easily browse through various courses, lessons, and learning materials with minimal effort. The layout is designed to be mobile-friendly, making learning accessible on any device.

2. Course and Lesson Management
The frontend supports structured course content, where each course consists of multiple lessons. Users can explore video tutorials, text-based learning materials, quizzes, and assignments to deepen their understanding of the subject matter.

3. Video Tutorials Integration
A major feature of the platform is the video-based learning module, where users can watch educational videos embedded from platforms like YouTube or hosted on cloud storage. The video player includes playback controls, allowing learners to pause, rewind, or speed up content as needed.

4. Progress Tracking
Users can track their learning progress through visual indicators such as progress bars or completion percentages. JavaScript functionalities help save the user's progress using local storage, ensuring they can resume from where they left off.

5. Interactive Quizzes and Assessments
To reinforce learning, the application includes quizzes and assessments after each lesson. These quizzes are built using JavaScript and provide instant feedback, helping learners evaluate their understanding of the subject.

6. Responsive Design
The use of Bootstrap’s grid system and components ensures that the application is fully responsive. It adapts to different screen sizes, making it ideal for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

7. Authentication & User Profiles (Future Scope)
While the current version is primarily frontend-based, future enhancements could include user authentication using Firebase or other backend services, enabling users to create profiles, save progress, and access personalized content.

Technologies Used
HTML – Structuring the content and layout of the platform.
CSS & Bootstrap – Styling and ensuring a responsive user interface.
